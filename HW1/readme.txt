All source image files are in data folder

1. Demosaicing

	First, execute matlab script hw1_1.m

	Second, you can see output file 'demosaicing.png' in the same folder.

2. Dithering

	First, execute matlab script hw1_2.m

	Second, the origin pictures are 'data/lena_gray.bmp' and 'data/choose.png'

	After execution, you will see the output images of 'data/lena_gray.bmp' and 'data/choose.png'

		for part (a) : 'thredsholding1.bmp' and 'thresholding2.png'

		for part (b) : 'error_dithering.bmp' and 'error_dithering.png'

	output files for part(a) & (b) are both in same folder

3. Interpolation

	First, execute matlab script hw1_3.m

	Second, the source image is 'data/Catvengers_gray.png'

	After execution about 2 ~ 3 minutes, you will see output images in the same folder : 

		for part(a) : output image 'output_NNI.png'

		for part(b) : output image 'output_BI.png'
