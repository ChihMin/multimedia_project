1. hw4 - (a)

	Execute hw4_1.m, there are two run sections.

	One is full-search, and the other is 2D-logarithmic.

	Then, the output of ..008 & ..017 residual images are in output folder

2. hw4 - (b)

	Execute hw4_2.m, there are three sections.

	One is to calculate full-search PSNR values for 10 frames,

	another is to calculate 2D-logarithmic ones, 

	and the other is to plot the PSNR of above algorithm.

3. hw3 - (c)

	Execute hw4_3.m, you will see the result of execution time.
